    "# Classifying Yelp Reviews\n",
    "In this notebook, I am fitting a machine learning model to Yelp data in order to predict whether a given Yelp review is positive or negative based on its text and on other user's reactions to that review. In particular, I use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to represent each review as a vector in a feature space where each word represents its own dimension. Next, I derive a number of additional features from the text to be used as additional predictors. Finally, I train a multinomial naïve Bayes classifier on a set of labeled data and evaluate its efficacy by testing it on a separate set of data."

Zipps decided to do a double-stacked specialtly burger. Yes, two 1/3 lb patties on a bun with some special toppings. We got two burgers and split them half and half, green chile burger and sweet jalapeno. Both were extremely awesome. You can get salad, fries, onion rings or half-half (half fries half onion rings). The fries kind of taste like In-n-Out fries, and my significant other would describe them as being better. I don't agree, and I don't disagree. Overall, good food, I can't wait to come back and try something else from their special menu. The $6 specialty burgers are available Tuesdays from 8-close and weekends from 11-4.\n",

Seriously though, it was some of the best service I've ever had at a Phoenix restaurant. To top it all off, the manager had checked up on us a few times, and at the end after we paid the bill he brought us a cookie platter (pizzookie, or cookie with ice cream).\n",

And the sounds and animatronics are a huge distraction from the so-so food.  The cocktails are alright, but, again, the price is not right.  The ony thing fun about the place for an adult is the gift shop and the light-up cocktail glasses (which cost extra.)

    "In fact, a model that classified every single review as a 5 star review would be 81.7% accurate, so that is the number to beat. This also means that classification accuracy is probably not a good performance measure. Instead, I'll be keeping an eye on the recall and precision scores for the 1 star category as well as the weighted f1 score averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few options to correct the inbalance in the dataset. Oversampling from the 1 star category is a good option since the dataset is not sufficiently large to undersample from the 5 star category. I can also penalize the model more for misclassifying negative reviews."

This is a strong assumption (and is actually where the \"naïve\" comes from) because variable independence is uncommon in practice. However, this type of model has proven to be effective even with some correlation between variables. Let's see how badly we might be violating that assumption."
